I am an experimental and computational immunologist interested in how the immune system makes decisions. I am particularly interested in how multiple cell types coordinate to provide host protection during infections and cancer. My work focuses primarily on the differentiation of CD8 T cells. An infection induces antigen specific naive CD8 T cells to undergo rapid proliferation and differentiation into a range of phenotypes that include highly cytotoxic and short lived cells as well as non-cytotoxic cells that persist for extremely long periods of time. Upon re-exposure to the same infection (or a variant of the same infection), long lived memory cells rapidly expand again driving a faster, larger, and more potent immune response than during the first exposure. Many therapeutic interventions, such as vaccines and checkpoint blockade immunotherapies, seek to tune these CD8 T cell behaviors and improve host defense. I study how CD8 T cells behave throughout this general process in a variety of contexts in order to inform new therapeutic strategies that can more effectively and precisely control CD8 T cell fate and function.
